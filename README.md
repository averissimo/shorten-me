# Shorten me

Available at [Firefox addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shorten_me/)

The extension I was previously using ([shortly](https://github.com/aloshbennett/shortly)) is
not webExtensions friendly so I created this very simple one that pretty much
does the same thing

## goo.gl API

Calls goo.gl API with own key that can be customizable in the preferences. Key
that is distributed with extension has a limit on 1.000.000 per day and others
per hour.

If the extension is successfull I guess an alternative method must be used.

- maybe by authenticating with OAUTH2.0 with google
- maube by using other well known service

## Icon

Simple 'S' made with [Airstream](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Airstream) font.
