# Shorten me

Available at [Firefox addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shorten_me/)

The extension I was previously using ([shortly](https://github.com/aloshbennett/shortly)) is
not webExtensions friendly so I created this very simple one that pretty much
does the same thing

## bit.ly API

Calls bit.ly API with own key that can be customizable in the preferences. Key
that is distributed with extension has a limit on 1.000 per hour and 100 per minute.

## Icon

Simple 'S' made with [Airstream](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Airstream) font.
