# Shorten me

> Create short urls in Firefox

Available at [Firefox addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shorten_me/)

This extension was created after webExtension transition in Firefox rendered several addons unusable. ([shortly](https://github.com/aloshbennett/shortly)) was one of them so I created this very simple one that pretty much does the same thing.

## shorten.escalar.pt

The short url generator service used is being self-hosted. bit.ly was previously used, but the changes in free plan has changed and it is no longer viable to use it.

The service is setup with visit tracking disabled, so that there are no analytics on the short-urls being generated.
